            <h1>CSS Tutorial</h1>
            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This article explains what CSS is with a simple syntax example and also covers some key terms about the
                language</p>
            <br>
            <p>
            <h3>In the Introduction to HTML module:</h3><br>
            <li> we covered what HTML is and how it is used to mark up documents.
                These documents will be readable in a web browser. Headings will look larger than regular text,
                paragraphs break onto a new line and have space between. <br>
            <li>Links are colored and underlined to distinguish them
                from the rest of the text. What you are seeing are the browser's default styles — very basic styles —
                that the browser
                applies to HTML to make sure that the page will be basically readable even if no explicit styling is
                specified by
                the author of the page.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
            <li>In the above example, the CSS rule opens with a selector. This selects the HTML element that we are
                going to style.
                In this case, we are styling level one headings (h1).
                We then have a set of curly braces
                <br>
            <li>Inside the braces will be one or more declarations, which take the form of property and value pairs.
                We specify the property (color in the above example) before the colon, and we specify the value of the
                property
                after the colon (red in this example).
                <br>
            <li>This example contains two declarations, one for color and the other for font-size. Each pair specifies
                a property of the element(s) we are selecting (h1 in this case), then a value that we'd like to give the
                property.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
            <li>As there are so many things that you could style using CSS, the language is broken down into modules.
                You'll see reference to these modules as you explore MDN. Many of the documentation pages are organized
                around
                a particular module. <br>
            <li>For example, you could take a look at the MDN reference to the Backgrounds and
                Borders module to find out what its purpose is and the properties and features it contains. In that
                module,
                you will also find a link to Specifications that defines the technology (also see the section below).

                <br>
            <li>At this stage, you don't need to worry too much about how CSS is structured; however, it can make
                it easier to find information if, for example, you are aware that a certain property is likely to
                be found among other similar things, and is therefore, probably in the same specification.

                <br>
            <li>For a specific example, let's go back to the Backgrounds and Borders module — you might think
                that it makes logical sense for the background-color and border-color properties to be defined in
                this module. And you'd be right.
