            <ul class="concepts">
                <li>
                    <h3>Variables & Data Types</h3>
                    <p>C++ is a statically-typed language, which means that it checks the data type of a variable at compile-time. There are various data types in C++ that can be used to declare variables.<br> These include:<br>

                        Integer types: char, int, unsigned int, short, unsigned short, long, unsigned long, long long, and unsigned long long.<br>
                        Floating-point types: float, double, and long double.<br>
                        Character types: char and wchar_t.<br>
                        Boolean type: bool.<br>
                        Pointer types: const pointer, non-const pointer, and pointer to pointer.<br>
                        Array and string types: array and string.<br>
                        Enumerated types: enum.<br>
                        Structure and class types: struct and class.<br>
                        Void type: void.</p>
                <li>
                    <h3>Operators</h3>
                    <p>C++ operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. They are used to manipulate data and perform various types of operations.<br> There are six types of operators in C++:<br></p>   
                    <p><h4>Arithmetic Operators</h4>Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on variables and data. For example:<br>int a = 5;<br>
                        int b = 3;<br>
                        int sum = a + b;  // sum is 8<br></p>
                    <p><h4>Assignment Operators</h4>Assignment operators are used to assign a value to a variable. For example:<br>
                        int x = 5;<br>
                        x = x + 2;  // x is now 7<br></p>
                    <p><h4>Comparison Operators</h4>Comparison operators are used to compare the values of two variables or expressions. For example:<br>
                        int a = 5;<br>
                        int b = 3;<br>
                        if (a > b) {<br>
                            cout << "a is greater than b";<br>
                        }<br></p>
                    <p><h4>Logical Operators</h4>Logical operators are used to combine the results of two or more conditions. For example:<br>
                        int a = 5;<br>
                        int b = 3;<br>
                        if (a > b && a < 10) {<br>
                            cout << "a is greater than b and less than 10";<br>
                        }<br></p>
                    <p><h4>Bitwise Operators</h4>Bitwise operators are used to perform bitwise operations on the binary representation of integers. For example:<br>
                        int a = 5;<br>
                        int b = 3;<br>
                        int result = a & b;  // result is 1<br></p>
                    <p><h4>Special Operators</h4>Special operators are used for specific purposes. For example:<br>
                        int a = 5;<br>
                        a++;  // increment a by 1<br></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Functions</h3>
                    <p>A function is a set of statements that takes input, does some specific computation, and produces output. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together to make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call this function.
                        In simple terms, a function is a block of code that runs only when it is called.</p> 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Classes and Objects</Object></h3>
                    <p>In C++, a class is a user-defined data type that can be used to create objects. It’s a blueprint or a template that defines the properties and behavior of an object. A class is a collection of variables (data members) and functions (member functions) that can be used to create objects.</p> 
                    <p>In C++, an object is an instance of a class. A class is a user-defined data type that has its own data members (attributes) and member functions (methods). Objects are essentially the instances of classes, and they have their own set of attributes and methods.<br>For example, consider the Car class. This class might have attributes such as wheels, speed limit, and mileage range, as well as methods such as drive and brake. An object of the Car class, let’s say named “myCar”, would have its own set of values for these attributes, such as 4 wheels, a speed limit of 120 km/h, and a mileage range of 500 miles.</p>   
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Inheritance</h3>
                    <p>Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a derived class to inherit properties and behavior from a base class. This concept enables code reuse, promotes modularity, and facilitates the creation of complex objects from simpler ones.<br>There are several types of inheritance in C++:<br>

                        1.Single Inheritance: A derived class inherits from a single base class.<br>
                        2.Multiple Inheritance: A derived class inherits from multiple base classes.<br>
                        3.Multilevel Inheritance: A derived class inherits from another derived class.<br>
                        4.Hierarchical Inheritance: A base class has multiple derived classes.<br>
                        5.Hybrid Inheritance: A combination of multiple and multilevel inheritance.</p>

                    <h3>Funtion Overloading and Operator Overloading</h3>
                    <p>Function overloading in C++ is a feature of object-oriented programming that allows multiple functions to have the same name but different parameters. This is also known as compile-time polymorphism, as the function to be called is determined at compile time based on the number and types of arguments passed.<br>

                        The key characteristics of function overloading are:<br>
                        
                        1.The function name must be the same for all overloaded functions.<br>
                        2.The function parameters must be different, either in number, type, or both.<br></p>
                    <p>Operator overloading in C++ is a feature that allows you to redefine the behavior of operators when working with user-defined data types. This is achieved by defining a special function inside a class, which is called an operator function.<br>

                        There are two types of operator overloading in C++: function overloading and operator overloading. Function overloading is when multiple functions with the same name can be defined, but with different parameter lists. Operator overloading is when an operator is given a special meaning for a user-defined data type.</p>
