            <p>JavaScript is a programming language that allows
                you to implement complex features on web pages.</p>

            <h3>This guide assumes you have the following
                basic background:</h3>

            <br>
            <li>A general understanding of the Internet
                and the World Wide Web (WWW).
                <br>
            <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText
                Markup Language (HTML).
                <br>
            <li>Some programming experience. If you
                are new to programming, try one of the tutorials
                linked on the main page about </p><br>

                <h3>The JavaScript documentation on MDN
                    includes the following: <br>
                </h3>

            <li>Learn Web Development provides information
                for beginners and introduces basic concepts of programming and the Internet.
                <br>
            <li>JavaScript Guide (this guide) provides an
                overview about the JavaScript language and its objects.
                <br>
            <li>JavaScript Reference provides detailed

                reference material for JavaScript.
                <br>
            <li>If you are new to JavaScript, start with the
                articles in the learning area and the JavaScript
                Guide. Once you have a firm grasp of the fundamentals,
                you can use the JavaScript Reference to get more
                details on individual objects and statements.

                </p>
                <p>
            <li>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive
                (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced
                server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a
                website than downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a
                host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
                environment to provide programmatic control over them.

                <br>
            <li>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
                for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:

                <br>
            <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements
                on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                <br>
            <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on
                a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
                provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file
                manipulations on a server.
                <br>
            <li>This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks. And, likewise,
                Node.js JavaScript on the server can respond to custom requests sent by code executed in the browser.
