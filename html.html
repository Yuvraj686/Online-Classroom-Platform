            <h1>HTML Tutorial</h1>
            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard 
                markup language for creating web pages.</p>
            <p> <li>HTML is a markup language that defines the 
                structure of your content. HTML consists of
                 a series of elements, which you use to enclose,
                  or wrap, different parts of the content to make
                   it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.
                    <br><li>The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink 
                    to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make 
                    the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
                    <br> <h3>For example, take the following line of content:</h3>

         </p>
<p>Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.

    paragraph element including opening tag, content reading 'my cat is very grumpy', and a closing tag
    The main parts of our element are as follows:
    <br><h4>The opening tag :</h4> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
    <br><h4>The closing tag: </h4>This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
    <br><h4>The content: </h4>This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
    <br><h4>The element :</h4>The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
